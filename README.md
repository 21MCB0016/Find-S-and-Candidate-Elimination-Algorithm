# Find-S-and-Candidate-Elimination-Algorithm
n terms of machine learning, the concept learning can be formulated as “Problem of searching through a predefined space of potential hypotheses for the hypothesis that best fits the training examples”. Find S and Candidate elimination Algorithm are two algorithms with implement the concept learning technique.
